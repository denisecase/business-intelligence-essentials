# BI Data Processes

Data Processes refer to the full spectrum of activities that manage and utilize data in Business Intelligence (BI).
These processes guide how data moves from collection all the way through to analysis and reporting.
Data Processes include Data Preparation and Data Analysis.

## Data Preparation

Data Preparation is a subset of data processes and involves getting raw data ready for analysis. 
It includes multiple steps that are essential for ensuring the data is clean, formatted, and structured properly. 
These steps typically follow the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) framework, along with additional activities like Data Cleaning and Data Integration.

### Data Collection & Extraction

The first step in the ETL process, where raw data is gathered from various sources like databases, files, or APIs for further preparation and analysis.

Tools Used: Python, SQL, Tableau Prep, Excel

### Data Integration

This step combines data from multiple sources into a unified view, ensuring consistency and coherence in the dataset before further preparation.

Tools Used: Tableau Prep, SQL, Python, Excel

### Data Cleaning

The process of identifying and correcting errors, handling missing values, removing duplicates, and eliminating outliers. 
This step is critical for improving the quality of the data.

Tools Used: Tableau Prep, SQL, Python, Excel

### Data Transformation

This involves modifying the data to fit the required structure for analysis. 
Transformations include normalization, aggregation, and formatting to ensure the data is suitable for reporting and querying.

Tools Used: Python, SQL, Tableau Prep, Excel

### Data Loading

The final step in the ETL process. 
After data has been transformed, it is loaded into the target system (e.g., database, warehouse) to support efficient querying and analysis.

Tools Used: Apache Spark, Python

## Data Analysis

Once data is collected, cleaned, transformed, and loaded, itâ€™s ready for Data Analysis. 
This process involves applying statistical, machine learning, or BI tools to the prepared data to generate insights, identify trends, and inform decision-making.

Tools Used: Power BI, Excel, Python, Tableau

## Tool Selection

Choosing the appropriate software tools or platforms based on the specific requirements of the project or analysis. 
This process is important to ensure data is handled efficiently.
Tool selection may depend on:

- The volume of data
- The complexity of processes required
- The specific outcomes desired from the data analysis
