# BI Data Processes

This page lists common processes in Business Intelligence (BI). 
Understanding these terms helps clarify how data is managed and utilized from initial collection through to analysis.
We list some commonly accessible tools used in each. 

## Extract

While not a focus in our class, extraction typically involves retrieving data from single or multiple sources, often as the first step in the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process. 
This process is essential for gathering the raw data needed for further processing and analysis.

## Data Integration

Combining data from different sources into a unified view to provide users with consistent access and delivery of data across the spectrum of subjects and structure types. 
This process is crucial for ensuring that all data elements are aligned and coherent.

- **Tableau Prep, SQL, Excel, and Python" are commonly used to combine data sources based on a common attribute.

## Data Cleaning

The process of detecting and correcting (or removing) corrupt or inaccurate records from a dataset, ensuring data quality. 
This includes dealing with outliers, missing values, and any misentered data to improve the overall quality and reliability of the data analysis.

- **Tableau Prep, SQL, Excel, and Python" are commonly used for cleaning data.

## Transform

Modifying data to ensure it adheres to the required format and quality for analysis and reporting. 
Transformations can include normalization, aggregation, and preparation of data for specific analytical needs.

- **SQL, Excel, and Python" are commonly used for cleaning data.
- **Tableau Prep** enables cleaning and provides a visual representation of data preparation workflows. 

## Load

The process of moving transformed data into a final target database, data warehouse, or data lake. 
This step is critical as it involves populating the data into a structure that supports efficient querying and analysis.

- **Apache Spark** can be used to load big data, along with **Python** and associated libraries. 

## Tool Selection

Choosing the appropriate software tools or platforms based on the specific requirements of the project or analysis. 
This process is important to ensure data is handled efficiently.
Tool selection may depend on:

- The volume of data
- The complexity of processes required
- The specific outcomes desired from the data analysis
